# Work In Progress #

This project and NuGet package are a work in progress. It is not finished yet. You are welcome to play with the bits while work continues.

## Builder Generator ##

This is a .Net Source Generator designed to add "Builders" to your projects. [Builders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) are an object creation pattern, similar to the [Object Mother](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html) pattern. Object Mothers and Builders are most commonly used to create objects for testing, but they can be used anywhere you want "canned" objects.

## Installing BuilderGenerator ##

Like other .Net Source Generators, BuilderGenerator operates as an analyzer. It is easiest to install it from its NuGet package.
