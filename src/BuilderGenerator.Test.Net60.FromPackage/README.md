# BuilderGenerator.Test.Net60.FromPackage

This project provides tests the BuilderGenerator package being used in a .Net 6.0 project using a simple series of inter-related classes defined in the BuiderGenerator.Test.Core project.

The reference to the BuilderGenerator is a NuGet package reference, so it can be used to check the results of the final product. It is meant to test the deployment mechanism.
