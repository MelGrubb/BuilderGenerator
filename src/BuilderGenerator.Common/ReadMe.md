# BuilderGenerator.Common #

This project contains support classes for the BuilderGenerator project. Because BuilderGenerator is added as an analyzer, the types it contains are not available to the project using it, so the Base "Buidler" class, as well as the "GenerateBuider" attributes are implemented in this separate assembly.
