# BuilderGenerator.Sample #

This project provides a demonstration for the BuilderGenerator project. A simple series of inter-related classes that should be used to exercise all of the edge cases when generating builders.

The reference to the BuilderGenerator is via NuGet, so this project demonstrates how the generators would be used in a real project rather than having any kind of direct reference to the BuilderGenerator project.
