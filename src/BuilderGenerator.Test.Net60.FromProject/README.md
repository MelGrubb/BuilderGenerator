# BuilderGenerator.Test.Net60.FromProject

This project provides tests the BuilderGenerator package being used in a .Net 6.0 project using a simple series of inter-related classes defined in the BuiderGenerator.Test.Core project.

The reference to the BuilderGenerator is a direct project reference, so it can be used to rapidly check the results of changes, but does not represent the real-world usage of the generator. It tests the functionality of the builder, but not the deployment mechanism.
