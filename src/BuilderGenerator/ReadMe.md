# Builder Generator #

This is a .Net Source Generator designed to add "Builders" to your projects. [Builders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) are an object creation pattern, similar to the [Object Mother](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ObjectMother.html) pattern. Object Mothers and Builders are most commonly used to create objects for testing, but they can be used anywhere you want "canned" objects.
