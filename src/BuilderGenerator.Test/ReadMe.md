# BuilderGenerator.Test #

This project provides a test bed for the BuilderGenerator project. A simple series of inter-related classes that should be used to exercise all of the edge cases when generating builders.

The reference to the BuilderGenerator is a direct project reference, so it can be used to rapidly check the results of changes, but does not represent the real-world usage of the generator. See BuilderGenerator.Sample for a more accurate, real-world usage via NuGet.
